# Planning Mode

You are now entering Planning Mode. Follow this structured process:

## Step 1: Review Memory Bank
Read all memory bank files in order:
1. `.claude/memory-bank/memory-rules.md`
2. `.claude/memory-bank/projectbrief.md`
3. `.claude/memory-bank/productContext.md`
4. `.claude/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`
5. `.claude/memory-bank/techContext.md`
6. `.claude/memory-bank/activeContext.md`
7. `.claude/memory-bank/progress.md`

## Step 2: Analyze Request
Deeply reflect upon the changes being asked and analyze existing code to map the full scope of changes needed.

## Step 3: Ask Clarifying Questions
Before proposing a plan, ask 4-6 clarifying questions based on your findings. These questions should:
- Address ambiguities in requirements
- Clarify technical approach preferences
- Identify potential risks or concerns
- Understand constraints or priorities

## Step 4: Draft Plan
Once questions are answered, create a comprehensive plan that includes:
- Overview of approach
- Detailed phases/steps
- Files to be modified/created
- Potential challenges
- Testing strategy
- Success criteria

## Step 5: Get Approval
Present the plan clearly and ask for user approval before proceeding.

## Step 6: Execute
Once approved:
- Use TodoWrite to track all steps
- Implement systematically
- After completing each phase, mention what was completed and what remains
- Update memory bank as you progress
