## Current Focus
**v2.0.1 released and ready for HACS installation.** Fixed HACS path issue by moving compiled files to repository root following established patterns from popular cards.

## Recent Changes

### October 30, 2025 - v2.0.1 Release (HACS Path Fix)
- **Changed**: Moved compiled files from dist/ to repository root
- **Why**: HACS 404 error - expected files at root, not in dist/
- **Impact**: HACS installation now works correctly
- **Key Changes**:
  - Build output: `dist/emergency-alerts-card.js` → `emergency-alerts-card.js` (root)
  - Updated `hacs.json`: removed `content_in_root: false`, simplified `filename`
  - Updated `rollup.config.js`: outputs to root
  - Updated `.gitignore`: keeps root .js files, ignores dist/
  - Updated `package.json`: v2.0.1, updated scripts
  - Updated CI/CD workflows: reference root files
- **Pattern**: Follows card-mod, button-card, boilerplate-card structure
- **Files**: 8 files modified, 2 new files in root
- **Testing**: Release workflow triggered, file accessible at GitHub

### October 30, 2025 - v2.0.0 Release (Switch Architecture)
- **Changed**: Created first release tag for v2.0 switch-based architecture
- **Why**: Publish production-ready v2.0 to GitHub for HACS installation
- **Impact**: v2.0.0 available as GitHub release with artifacts
- **Key Changes**:
  - Deleted `www/` directory (old structure with only .d.ts files)
  - Rebuilt `dist/` to ensure current v2.0 code
  - Created annotated v2.0.0 tag with comprehensive release notes
  - Pushed tag to trigger release workflow
- **Release Notes**: Featured switch architecture, snooze, auto-escalation, breaking changes
- **Discovered Issue**: HACS couldn't load file (404 error) - led to v2.0.1 fix

### October 30, 2025 - Memory Bank Consolidation
- **Changed**: Updated memory bank files and consolidated documentation
- **Why**: Reflect v2.0 as current version, remove outdated historical docs
- **Impact**: Memory bank accurately reflects production state
- **Key Changes**:
  - Updated `projectbrief.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md` for v2.0
  - Filled in `CLAUDE.md` with actual project intelligence and user preferences
  - Removed 5 outdated markdown files (HACS_COMPLIANCE.md, etc.)
  - Documented user preference: simple, current-focused docs (no version drama)

### October 29, 2025 - Comprehensive Refactoring (v1.1)
- **Changed**: Complete architectural refactoring of entire codebase
- **Why**: Address technical debt, improve maintainability, testability, and performance
- **Impact**: Production-ready code with 9 focused modules, comprehensive testing, and robust error handling
- **Key Changes**:
  - Split 1409-line monolithic file into 9 modules (types, styles, services, 5 utils)
  - Created AlertService with comprehensive error handling
  - Implemented loading states (Set-based tracking)
  - Added performance optimizations (hash-based change detection, regex caching)
  - Eliminated all 41 `any` types with proper TypeScript interfaces
  - Increased test coverage from 34% to 87% (utils) and 100% (services)
  - Enabled sourcemaps in build and CI validation
  - Configured git hooks (Husky + lint-staged)
  - Enhanced CI/CD with artifact uploads
  - Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- **Documentation**: REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md (600+ lines detailing all changes)

### October 29, 2025 - Memory Bank Setup & Update
- **Changed**: Created and populated Memory Bank system, then updated with refactoring changes
- **Why**: Enable context preservation across Claude Code sessions for more effective AI assistance
- **Impact**: Future sessions will have full project context automatically loaded with current architecture
- **Files Updated**:
  - `.claude/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Updated with modular architecture and new patterns
  - `.claude/memory-bank/techContext.md` - Updated technical debt (most items resolved)
  - `.claude/memory-bank/progress.md` - Updated metrics and completed milestones
  - `.claude/memory-bank/activeContext.md` - This file (current state)
  - All other memory bank files populated initially

### August 28, 2024 - HACS Compliance
- **Changed**: Restructured output to `www/dist/` folder
- **Why**: HACS requires specific folder structure with `content_in_root: false`
- **Impact**: Card now installable through HACS
- **Files**: `hacs.json`, build scripts, folder structure

### July 2024 - Feature Expansion
- **Changed**: Added extensive configuration options
- **Why**: Support diverse user needs and dashboard configurations
- **Impact**: Card now highly customizable (20+ config options)
- **Files**: `src/emergency-alerts-card.ts` - Config handling and rendering logic

## Active Decisions

### Decision in Progress: None currently
No active decisions requiring input at this time. v2.0.1 released and ready for user testing in HACS.

## Next Steps
### Immediate (Current Session)
- [x] Complete v2.0.0 release
- [x] Delete www/ directory
- [x] Fix HACS installation path issue
- [x] Move compiled files to root
- [x] Release v2.0.1
- [x] Update memory bank with all changes

### Short Term (Next Few Sessions)
- [ ] Consider component integration tests (utils/services already well-tested)
- [ ] Monitor user feedback on refactored version
- [ ] Monitor HACS installation issues (if any)
- [ ] Consider accessibility improvements
- [ ] Consider confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### Blocked/Waiting
- [ ] HACS official repository listing - **Blocked by**: Manual review process by HACS team

## Current Challenges
_No major challenges at this time. Comprehensive refactoring addressed most technical challenges._

### Historical Challenges (Resolved):
- ~~**AI-Assisted Development Learning Curve**~~ → Solution: Memory Bank system implemented
- ~~**Limited TypeScript/Lit Expertise**~~ → Solution: Comprehensive documentation and patterns documented
- ~~**Code maintainability**~~ → Solution: Modular architecture implemented
- ~~**Test coverage**~~ → Solution: 74 comprehensive tests, 87-100% coverage for modules
- ~~**Performance concerns**~~ → Solution: Hash-based change detection, regex caching

## Open Questions
- Should the card support custom severity colors and levels? (lower priority now)
- ~~Is the current entity discovery performance acceptable for large Home Assistant instances?~~ → **RESOLVED**: Hash-based optimization implemented
- Should there be a confirmation dialog for destructive actions (clear, escalate)?
- Would users benefit from batch operations (clear all, acknowledge all)?
- Do we need component integration tests, or is the current utils/services coverage sufficient?

## Recently Resolved (October 2025 Refactoring)
- **Large monolithic file (1409 lines)** - Solution: Split into 9 focused modules
- **No error handling** - Solution: AlertService class with comprehensive error handling
- **No loading states** - Solution: Set-based tracking with UI indicators
- **Performance issues** - Solution: Hash-based change detection + regex caching
- **Type safety (41 `any` types)** - Solution: Proper TypeScript interfaces throughout
- **Low test coverage (34%)** - Solution: 74 tests, 87% utils, 100% services
- **No sourcemaps** - Solution: Enabled and validated in CI
- **No git hooks** - Solution: Husky + lint-staged configured
- **Inadequate CI/CD** - Solution: Enhanced with sourcemap validation and artifacts

### Historical (Pre-Refactoring):
- **HACS folder structure** - Solution: Restructured to use `www/dist/` with `content_in_root: false`
- **HACS validation failures** - Solution: Fixed `hacs.json` structure, ensured proper file paths
- **Button logic complexity** - Solution: Implemented smart button visibility based on alert state
- **Alert grouping flexibility** - Solution: Strategy pattern with multiple grouping options

## Context Notes

- Ready for HACS custom repository installation
- Compiled file at repository root: `emergency-alerts-card.js` (49KB)
- Follows standard HACS pattern (card-mod, button-card style)
- All changes committed to main branch
- GitHub Actions release workflow running for v2.0.1
- Memory Bank fully updated with v2.0 architecture and release process
- Project uses AI assistance heavily (Claude/Cursor) - modular architecture makes this effective
