## Current Focus
**Project in maintenance mode after successful v1.1 comprehensive refactoring.** Memory Bank system fully updated with new modular architecture, patterns, and lessons learned from October 2025 refactoring session.

## Recent Changes

### October 29, 2025 - Comprehensive Refactoring (v1.1)
- **Changed**: Complete architectural refactoring of entire codebase
- **Why**: Address technical debt, improve maintainability, testability, and performance
- **Impact**: Production-ready code with 9 focused modules, comprehensive testing, and robust error handling
- **Key Changes**:
  - Split 1409-line monolithic file into 9 modules (types, styles, services, 5 utils)
  - Created AlertService with comprehensive error handling
  - Implemented loading states (Set-based tracking)
  - Added performance optimizations (hash-based change detection, regex caching)
  - Eliminated all 41 `any` types with proper TypeScript interfaces
  - Increased test coverage from 34% to 87% (utils) and 100% (services)
  - Enabled sourcemaps in build and CI validation
  - Configured git hooks (Husky + lint-staged)
  - Enhanced CI/CD with artifact uploads
  - Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- **Documentation**: REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md (600+ lines detailing all changes)

### October 29, 2025 - Memory Bank Setup & Update
- **Changed**: Created and populated Memory Bank system, then updated with refactoring changes
- **Why**: Enable context preservation across Claude Code sessions for more effective AI assistance
- **Impact**: Future sessions will have full project context automatically loaded with current architecture
- **Files Updated**:
  - `.claude/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Updated with modular architecture and new patterns
  - `.claude/memory-bank/techContext.md` - Updated technical debt (most items resolved)
  - `.claude/memory-bank/progress.md` - Updated metrics and completed milestones
  - `.claude/memory-bank/activeContext.md` - This file (current state)
  - All other memory bank files populated initially

### August 28, 2024 - HACS Compliance
- **Changed**: Restructured output to `www/dist/` folder
- **Why**: HACS requires specific folder structure with `content_in_root: false`
- **Impact**: Card now installable through HACS
- **Files**: `hacs.json`, build scripts, folder structure

### July 2024 - Feature Expansion
- **Changed**: Added extensive configuration options
- **Why**: Support diverse user needs and dashboard configurations
- **Impact**: Card now highly customizable (20+ config options)
- **Files**: `src/emergency-alerts-card.ts` - Config handling and rendering logic

## Active Decisions

### Decision in Progress: None currently
No active decisions requiring input at this time. Core functionality is stable and feature-complete for v1.1 (post-refactoring). Project in maintenance mode.

## Next Steps
### Immediate (Current Session)
- [x] Complete comprehensive refactoring
- [x] Create REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md
- [x] Create Memory Bank structure
- [x] Populate all memory bank files
- [x] Update memory bank with refactoring changes
- [ ] Commit all changes to git (pending user decision)

### Short Term (Next Few Sessions)
- [ ] Consider component integration tests (utils/services already well-tested)
- [ ] Monitor user feedback on refactored version
- [ ] Monitor HACS installation issues (if any)
- [ ] Consider accessibility improvements
- [ ] Consider confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### Blocked/Waiting
- [ ] HACS official repository listing - **Blocked by**: Manual review process by HACS team

## Current Challenges
_No major challenges at this time. Comprehensive refactoring addressed most technical challenges._

### Historical Challenges (Resolved):
- ~~**AI-Assisted Development Learning Curve**~~ → Solution: Memory Bank system implemented
- ~~**Limited TypeScript/Lit Expertise**~~ → Solution: Comprehensive documentation and patterns documented
- ~~**Code maintainability**~~ → Solution: Modular architecture implemented
- ~~**Test coverage**~~ → Solution: 74 comprehensive tests, 87-100% coverage for modules
- ~~**Performance concerns**~~ → Solution: Hash-based change detection, regex caching

## Open Questions
- Should the card support custom severity colors and levels? (lower priority now)
- ~~Is the current entity discovery performance acceptable for large Home Assistant instances?~~ → **RESOLVED**: Hash-based optimization implemented
- Should there be a confirmation dialog for destructive actions (clear, escalate)?
- Would users benefit from batch operations (clear all, acknowledge all)?
- Do we need component integration tests, or is the current utils/services coverage sufficient?

## Recently Resolved (October 2025 Refactoring)
- **Large monolithic file (1409 lines)** - Solution: Split into 9 focused modules
- **No error handling** - Solution: AlertService class with comprehensive error handling
- **No loading states** - Solution: Set-based tracking with UI indicators
- **Performance issues** - Solution: Hash-based change detection + regex caching
- **Type safety (41 `any` types)** - Solution: Proper TypeScript interfaces throughout
- **Low test coverage (34%)** - Solution: 74 tests, 87% utils, 100% services
- **No sourcemaps** - Solution: Enabled and validated in CI
- **No git hooks** - Solution: Husky + lint-staged configured
- **Inadequate CI/CD** - Solution: Enhanced with sourcemap validation and artifacts

### Historical (Pre-Refactoring):
- **HACS folder structure** - Solution: Restructured to use `www/dist/` with `content_in_root: false`
- **HACS validation failures** - Solution: Fixed `hacs.json` structure, ensured proper file paths
- **Button logic complexity** - Solution: Implemented smart button visibility based on alert state
- **Alert grouping flexibility** - Solution: Strategy pattern with multiple grouping options

## Context Notes
- This is a stable, feature-complete project at v1.1 (post-refactoring)
- **Major milestone**: Comprehensive refactoring completed October 2025
- Primary focus is now maintenance and responding to user feedback
- Memory Bank fully populated and updated with current architecture
- Project branch is `memory-bank`, main branch is `main`
- Untracked files in git: memory bank files pending commit
- TypeScript declaration files now properly gitignored
- Project uses AI assistance heavily (Claude/Cursor) - modular architecture makes this more effective
- Companion project: Emergency Alerts integration (separate repository)
- See REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md for complete refactoring details
