## In Progress 🚧

_No active work in progress. Project in maintenance mode._

## Planned 📋

### Near Term
- [x] ~~Improve test coverage to >60%~~ - **DONE**: 87% utils, 100% services (October 2025)
- [x] ~~Add error handling for service call failures~~ - **DONE**: AlertService (October 2025)
- [x] ~~Implement loading states for async operations~~ - **DONE**: Set-based tracking (October 2025)
- [ ] Add component integration tests - Priority: Medium
- [ ] Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions - Priority: Low

### Future
- [ ] Batch operations (clear all, acknowledge all) - When user requests it
- [ ] Custom severity colors configuration - If user demand exists
- [ ] Alert history view - Requires integration changes
- [ ] Internationalization (i18n) support - If community interest
- [ ] Performance optimization (memoization, virtual scrolling) - If performance issues reported
- [ ] Accessibility improvements (ARIA, screen reader testing) - Ongoing

## Deferred ⏸️
- **Mobile app version** - Reason: Out of scope, web-only focus
- **Alert creation UI** - Reason: Belongs in integration, not card
- **Backend notification logic** - Reason: Handled by integration and automations
- **Multi-instance sync** - Reason: No clear use case, complex implementation

## HACS Distribution Lessons Learned 📚

### Critical Knowledge (v2.0.6-v2.0.8 Debugging)

**1. Release Asset Structure**
- ✅ HACS downloads **individual files** from GitHub release assets
- ❌ HACS does NOT extract zip or tar.gz archives
- ✅ Upload: `emergency-alerts-card.js` directly
- ❌ Upload: `emergency-alerts-card-v2.0.8.zip` (WRONG!)
- **Reference**: gauge-card-pro, calendar-card-pro use raw JS files

**2. hacs.json Configuration**
- ✅ Valid fields for PLUGINS: `name`, `filename`, `homeassistant`, `render_readme`
- ❌ `content_in_root` is ONLY for INTEGRATIONS, not plugins!
- Adding invalid fields confuses HACS file discovery logic
- **Always verify**: https://hacs.xyz/docs/publish/plugin

**3. File Naming Convention**
- Repository: `lovelace-emergency-alerts-card`
- File: `emergency-alerts-card.js` ✅
- HACS allows "lovelace-" prefix to be stripped from filename
- Both `lovelace-emergency-alerts-card.js` and `emergency-alerts-card.js` are valid

**4. File Location**
- Files in repository root ✅
- `dist/` folder is gitignored ✅
- Build outputs to root via rollup.config.js ✅
- HACS searches: dist/ (first), then root (second)

**5. Minification**
- Terser is configured and working ✅
- Bundle size: 49KB (minified + sourcemap)
- File is properly minified (single-line, short var names)
- No additional optimization needed

**6. Debugging HACS Issues**
- Check: `~/config/www/community/lovelace-emergency-alerts-card/`
- Should contain: `emergency-alerts-card.js` ✅
- Should NOT contain: `.zip`, `.tar.gz` files ❌
- Test URL: `http://homeassistant:8123/hacsfiles/lovelace-emergency-alerts-card/emergency-alerts-card.js`
- Check resources: Settings → Dashboards → Resources
- Browser console shows 404 errors if files missing

**7. Card Picker Registration (window.customCards)**
- ✅ Registration type: `'emergency-alerts-card'` (NO prefix!)
- ❌ Registration type: `'custom:emergency-alerts-card'` (WRONG - has prefix)
- The `custom:` prefix is ONLY used in dashboard config YAML/JSON
- The `window.customCards` array should register WITHOUT prefix
- Example from button-card: Registers as `'button-card'`, used as `'custom:button-card'`
- Example from calendar-card-pro: Registers as `'calendar-card-pro-dev'`
- **Location**: src/emergency-alerts-card.ts:1250
- **Test**: `window.customCards.find(c => c.type.includes('emergency'))`
- **Verification**: Card appears in Settings → Dashboards → Add Card → By Card

## Known Issues

### Critical 🔴
None currently identified

### Important 🟡
_None - All previously identified important issues resolved in October 2025 refactoring_

### Minor 🟢
- **Component test coverage**: Utils and services well-tested, but main component needs integration tests
- **TypeScript declaration files**: Now properly gitignored (.gitignore updated October 2025)

## What Works Well
- **Zero-config operation**: Card works immediately after installation
- **Smart button logic**: Clear UX, no confusion about available actions
- **Flexible configuration**: Supports diverse use cases
- **HACS distribution**: Easy installation and updates
- **Lit framework integration**: Smooth reactive updates
- **Responsive design**: Works well on desktop and mobile
- **Home Assistant integration**: Seamless service calls and state management
- **Modular architecture**: Easy to navigate, test, and maintain (October 2025)
- **Error handling**: User-friendly notifications with console logging (October 2025)
- **Performance**: Optimized for large HA instances with hash-based change detection (October 2025)
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces (October 2025)
- **Loading states**: Clear visual feedback during async operations (October 2025)

## What Needs Improvement
- **Component integration tests**: Main component needs end-to-end tests (utils/services well-tested)
- **Accessibility**: Not thoroughly tested with screen readers or automated a11y tools
- **Confirmation dialogs**: Destructive actions (clear, escalate) execute immediately
- **Custom severity levels**: Hardcoded colors and levels, not user-configurable
- **Internationalization**: English-only, no i18n framework implemented

## Changelog

### v2.0.9 (October 31, 2025) - Card Picker Registration Fix ✅
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Fixed card not appearing in Home Assistant dashboard card picker
- **Root Cause**: `window.customCards` registration used wrong type format
- **The Problem**:
  - Registration used: `type: 'custom:emergency-alerts-card'` (WRONG)
  - The `custom:` prefix is only for dashboard configuration, NOT registration
  - Home Assistant's card picker couldn't find the card due to wrong type
- **The Fix**:
  - Changed registration to: `type: 'emergency-alerts-card'` (CORRECT - no prefix)
  - Researched working cards: button-card, calendar-card-pro both register without prefix
  - Updated src/emergency-alerts-card.ts:1250
  - Rebuilt emergency-alerts-card.js with correct registration
- **Impact**: Card now appears in Settings → Dashboards → Add Card → By Card picker!

### v2.0.8 (October 31, 2025) - HACS Release Asset Fix ✅
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Fixed HACS file download by uploading raw JS files to release assets
- **Root Cause**: HACS downloads individual files from GitHub release assets, not archives
- **The Problem**:
  - v2.0.0-v2.0.7 uploaded tar.gz and zip files
  - HACS downloaded these archives but couldn't serve them as JS
  - Result: Files in www/community/ were .zip and .tar.gz instead of .js
- **The Fix**:
  - Modified release.yml to upload emergency-alerts-card.js directly
  - Also uploads emergency-alerts-card.js.map for debugging
  - Removed all packaging steps (tar/zip creation)
  - Matches pattern from gauge-card-pro, calendar-card-pro
- **Impact**: HACS now correctly downloads .js file and card loads successfully!

### v2.0.7 (October 31, 2025) - HACS Config Fix (Partial) ⚠️
- **Bug Fix**: Removed invalid `content_in_root` field from hacs.json
- `content_in_root` is only for INTEGRATIONS, not PLUGINS (dashboard cards)
- Still failed because release workflow uploaded tar.gz/zip instead of raw JS
- Led to v2.0.8 which fixed the packaging issue

### v2.0.6 (October 31, 2025) - HACS content_in_root Attempt ❌
- **Bug Introduced**: Added `content_in_root: true` to hacs.json (WRONG!)
- This field is only valid for integrations, not plugins
- Caused HACS to fail downloading files completely
- Important lesson: Research HACS documentation before adding fields

### v2.0.5 (October 31, 2025) - Card Loading Fix
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed card crash when adding via UI with empty/minimal configuration
- Root cause: Overly strict validation in setConfig() rejected configs without type field
- Solution: Removed `!config.type` check - HA provides type field via framework
- Impact: Card now loads successfully when added through HA UI card picker
- All 90 tests passing, no TypeScript warnings

### v2.0.4 (October 31, 2025) - Card Registration & HACS Validation Fixes
- **Bug Fixes**: Fixed two critical issues preventing proper card operation
- Added 'custom:' prefix to card registration (was: 'emergency-alerts-card', now: 'custom:emergency-alerts-card')
- Removed invalid "type": "plugin" from hacs.json (HACS error: `extra keys not allowed @ data['type']`)
- Impact: Card properly registers with HA and passes HACS validation
- Merged from fix/card-registration-prefix branch via PR #4

### v2.0.1 (October 30, 2025) - HACS Path Fix
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed 404 error when installing via HACS custom repository
- Moved compiled files from `dist/` to repository root
- Simplified `hacs.json` (removed `content_in_root`, simplified `filename`)
- Updated build system to output to root
- Updated CI/CD workflows to reference root files
- Follows established pattern from card-mod, button-card, boilerplate-card
- **Impact**: HACS installation now works correctly

### v2.0.0 (October 30, 2025) - Switch-Based Architecture
- **Major Release**: Complete rewrite with switch-based control
- **New Features**:
  - Switch-based architecture (control via switch entities)
  - Snooze functionality (5-minute auto-expiring silence)
  - Automatic escalation (after 5 minutes without acknowledgment)
  - Visual status badges (active, acknowledged, snoozed, escalated, resolved)
  - Animations (pulsing effects for snoozed/escalated)
  - Tooltips for each action switch
- **Breaking Changes**:
  - Requires Emergency Alerts Integration v2.0+
  - Config: `show_cleared` → `show_resolved`, `cleared` → `resolved`
  - Backend enforces mutual exclusivity (only one switch active)
- **Technical**:
  - 90 unit tests passing
  - Full type safety with TypeScript
