- **Notes**: Allows flexible organization based on user preference

#### Filtering System
- **Completed**: July 2024
- **Files**: src/emergency-alerts-card.ts:454-482
- **Description**: Filter by severity, group, and status with both config options and individual toggles
- **Notes**: Uses filter chain pattern for sequential filtering

#### Sorting Options
- **Completed**: July 2024
- **Files**: src/emergency-alerts-card.ts:484-509
- **Description**: Sort by first_triggered (time), severity, name, or group
- **Notes**: Newest alerts appear first when sorted by time

#### Compact Mode
- **Completed**: July 2024
- **Files**: src/emergency-alerts-card.ts:79-299 (CSS), rendering logic
- **Description**: Space-efficient display mode with smaller buttons and reduced padding
- **Notes**: Includes mobile-responsive adjustments

#### Timestamp Display
- **Completed**: July 2024
- **Files**: src/emergency-alerts-card.ts:548-559

#### Comprehensive Configuration
- **Completed**: July 2024
- **Files**: src/emergency-alerts-card.ts:12-44 (CardConfig interface), 302-333 (setConfig)

- **Notes**: Zero-config defaults with extensive customization options

#### Comprehensive Refactoring (v1.1)
- **Completed**: October 2025
- **Duration**: Single comprehensive session
- **Files**: 30+ files created/modified
- **Description**: Major architectural refactoring addressing all identified code quality issues
- **Key Improvements**:
  1. **Modular Architecture**: Split 1409-line file into 9 focused modules (types, styles, services, utils)
  2. **Error Handling**: AlertService class with console logging and user notifications
  3. **Loading States**: Set-based tracking with UI indicators (⏳)
  4. **Performance**: Hash-based change detection + regex caching
  5. **Type Safety**: Eliminated 41 `any` types with proper HA interfaces
  6. **Testing**: 6 comprehensive test suites, 74 tests (87% utils, 100% services coverage)
  7. **Sourcemaps**: Enabled and validated in CI for debugging
  8. **Git Hooks**: Husky + lint-staged for pre-commit validation
  9. **CI/CD**: Enhanced with sourcemap validation and artifact uploads
  10. **Documentation**: JSDoc comments throughout + REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md
- **Impact**: Production-ready code with maintainability, testability, and performance improvements
- **Files**: See REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md for complete list

## In Progress 🚧

_No active work in progress. Project in maintenance mode._

## Planned 📋

### Near Term
- [x] ~~Improve test coverage to >60%~~ - **DONE**: 87% utils, 100% services (October 2025)
- [x] ~~Add error handling for service call failures~~ - **DONE**: AlertService (October 2025)
- [x] ~~Implement loading states for async operations~~ - **DONE**: Set-based tracking (October 2025)
- [ ] Add component integration tests - Priority: Medium
- [ ] Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions - Priority: Low

### Future
- [ ] Batch operations (clear all, acknowledge all) - When user requests it
- [ ] Custom severity colors configuration - If user demand exists
- [ ] Alert history view - Requires integration changes
- [ ] Internationalization (i18n) support - If community interest
- [ ] Performance optimization (memoization, virtual scrolling) - If performance issues reported
- [ ] Accessibility improvements (ARIA, screen reader testing) - Ongoing

## Deferred ⏸️
- **Mobile app version** - Reason: Out of scope, web-only focus
- **Alert creation UI** - Reason: Belongs in integration, not card
- **Backend notification logic** - Reason: Handled by integration and automations
- **Multi-instance sync** - Reason: No clear use case, complex implementation

## Known Issues

### Critical 🔴
None currently identified

### Important 🟡
_None - All previously identified important issues resolved in October 2025 refactoring_

### Minor 🟢
- **Component test coverage**: Utils and services well-tested, but main component needs integration tests
- **TypeScript declaration files**: Now properly gitignored (.gitignore updated October 2025)

## What Works Well
- **Zero-config operation**: Card works immediately after installation
- **Smart button logic**: Clear UX, no confusion about available actions
- **Flexible configuration**: Supports diverse use cases
- **HACS distribution**: Easy installation and updates
- **Lit framework integration**: Smooth reactive updates
- **Responsive design**: Works well on desktop and mobile
- **Home Assistant integration**: Seamless service calls and state management
- **Modular architecture**: Easy to navigate, test, and maintain (October 2025)
- **Error handling**: User-friendly notifications with console logging (October 2025)
- **Performance**: Optimized for large HA instances with hash-based change detection (October 2025)
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces (October 2025)
- **Loading states**: Clear visual feedback during async operations (October 2025)

## What Needs Improvement
- **Component integration tests**: Main component needs end-to-end tests (utils/services well-tested)
- **Accessibility**: Not thoroughly tested with screen readers or automated a11y tools
- **Confirmation dialogs**: Destructive actions (clear, escalate) execute immediately
- **Custom severity levels**: Hardcoded colors and levels, not user-configurable
- **Internationalization**: English-only, no i18n framework implemented
