- Every architectural decision (e.g., transport patterns, bootstrap logic) must be recorded in `architecture.md`.
- Use bullet lists with headings and dates.
- When modifying major flows (e.g., RPC patterns, microservice triggers), append rationale and update diagrams.
- Provide links to PR or issue in each entry if available.
