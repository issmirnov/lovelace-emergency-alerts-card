A custom Lovelace card for displaying emergency alerts from the Emergency Alerts integration.

## ðŸ“¢ Project Status

### Current Stable Version: v1.0.0 (main branch)
The current stable version uses a button-based interface with acknowledge, escalate, and clear actions.

### ðŸš§ v2.0.0 In Development ([PR #2](https://github.com/issmirnov/lovelace-emergency-alerts-card/pull/2))
A major rewrite is underway featuring:
- **Switch-based architecture** (replacing service call buttons with toggleable switches)
- **Snooze functionality** (5-minute auto-expiring silence)
- **Automatic escalation** (after 5 minutes if not acknowledged)
- **Enhanced visual feedback** (status badges, animations, active state indicators)
- **Improved UX** (tooltips, better state representation)

**Status**: All tests passing (90/90), ready for testing and review.

### Development Approach

This project serves as an experiment in AI-assisted development, built primarily with Claude Code and Cursor. The codebase demonstrates:
- Full TypeScript with comprehensive type safety
- Test-driven development (90 unit tests with Jest)
- Modern web components using Lit
- CI/CD with automated testing and validation

**Note**: While AI-assisted, the code follows industry best practices with:
- âœ… Comprehensive test coverage
- âœ… TypeScript strict mode
- âœ… ESLint + Prettier enforcement
- âœ… Pre-commit hooks
- âœ… HACS validation

Feel free to contribute improvements or provide feedback on the v2.0 rewrite!

## Features

- **Real-time Alert Display**: Shows active emergency alerts with severity indicators
- **Alert Grouping**: Groups alerts by severity, status, group, or none
- **Switch-Based Actions** (v2.0): Toggle switches for Acknowledge, Snooze (5min), and Resolve
- **Visual State Indicators**: Animated status badges, color-coded borders, and pulsing effects
- **Smart State Management**: Backend enforces mutual exclusivity - only one response state active at a time
- **Automatic Escalation**: Alerts auto-escalate after 5 minutes if not acknowledged
- **Time Tracking**: Shows when alerts were first triggered and snooze expiration times
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes with mobile-optimized layouts
- **Home Assistant Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the Emergency Alerts integration v2.0+

## v2.0 Alert Action Switches Explained

**BREAKING CHANGE**: v2.0 introduces a switch-based architecture replacing the old button-based system.

The Emergency Alerts Card now provides **three toggle switches** for each alert, with mutual exclusivity enforced by the backend:

| Switch         | What It Does | Behavior | Visual State |
|----------------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| **Acknowledge** | Mark as "working on it" - prevents auto-escalation | Toggle ON/OFF | Green glow when active |
| **Snooze (5m)** | Silence for 5 minutes - auto-expires | Turns ON (auto-turns OFF after 5min) | Orange glow with pulse animation |
| **Resolve**    | Mark as fixed - won't re-trigger until condition fully clears | Toggle ON/OFF | Blue glow when active |

**Key v2.0 Behaviors:**

- **Mutual Exclusivity**: Only ONE switch can be ON at a time. Turning one ON automatically turns others OFF.
- **Auto-Escalation**: If an active alert isn't acknowledged within 5 minutes, it automatically escalates (pulsing red animation).
- **Snooze Auto-Expiry**: Snooze automatically expires after 5 minutes, returning alert to previous state.
- **Tooltips**: Hover over switches to see detailed explanations of their behavior.
- **Visual Feedback**: Active switches show colored glows, status badges, and animations.

**Example Scenario:**
1. **Alert triggers** (e.g., "Water Leak Detected"): All switches OFF, alert shows as "ACTIVE" badge.
2. You toggle **Acknowledge** ON: Alert badge changes to "ACKNOWLEDGED" (green), alert won't auto-escalate.
3. You toggle **Snooze** ON: Acknowledge automatically turns OFF, "SNOOZED" badge appears (orange with pulse), shows "until 2:35 PM".
4. After 5 minutes: Snooze expires, returns to acknowledged state (or active if it wasn't acknowledged before).
5. You toggle **Resolve** ON: All other switches turn OFF, "RESOLVED" badge appears (blue), alert fades to 50% opacity.
6. Condition re-occurs: If physical condition re-triggers while resolved, alert won't re-activate until resolve is turned OFF.

**Escalation (Automatic Only in v2.0):**
- Escalation is **automatic** - no manual escalate button.
- Alerts escalate after 5 minutes if not acknowledged.
- Escalated alerts show pulsing red "ESCALATED" badge and wider border.
- Acknowledging an escalated alert returns it to acknowledged state (de-escalates automatically).

Here's a complete Lovelace dashboard configuration showing different card variations:

```yaml
resources:
  - url: /local/emergency-alerts-card.js
    type: module

views:
  - title: Emergency Dashboard
    cards:
      # Basic emergency alerts card with v2.0 features
      - type: custom:emergency-alerts-card

        show_acknowledged: true
        show_snoozed: true
        show_resolved: true
        show_status_badge: true
        title: "Alert Status Overview"

      # Security-focused view with snooze enabled
      - type: custom:emergency-alerts-card
        group_by: "group"
        group_filter: ["security"]
        severity_filter: ["critical", "warning"]
        show_snooze_button: true
        show_status_badge: true
        title: "Security Alerts"
```

## Expected Entity Structure

The Emergency Alerts Card expects binary sensors with specific attributes from the Emergency Alerts Integration:

### Entity Format
```yaml
# Entity ID pattern
binary_sensor.emergency_[alert_name]

# Example entities
binary_sensor.emergency_fire_alarm
binary_sensor.emergency_door_open
binary_sensor.emergency_water_leak
```

### Required Attributes (v2.0)
```yaml
# State
state: 'on' (alert active) or 'off' (alert inactive)

# Required attributes
friendly_name: "Emergency: Fire Alarm Triggered"
severity: "critical" | "warning" | "info"
group: "security" | "safety" | "environmental" | "maintenance"

# Status tracking (v2.0 - updated)
acknowledged: boolean
escalated: boolean        # Auto-set by backend after 5 minutes
snoozed: boolean         # NEW in v2.0
resolved: boolean        # RENAMED from "cleared"
first_triggered: "2024-12-19T10:30:00Z"     # ISO datetime string
snooze_until: "2024-12-19T10:35:00Z"        # NEW in v2.0 - ISO datetime (optional)
last_resolved: "2024-12-19T11:00:00Z"       # RENAMED from last_cleared (optional)
```

### Example Entity (v2.0)
```yaml
binary_sensor.emergency_fire_alarm:
  state: 'on'
  friendly_name: "Emergency: Fire Alarm Triggered"
  severity: "critical"
  group: "safety"
  acknowledged: false
  escalated: false
  snoozed: false
  resolved: false
  first_triggered: "2024-12-19T10:30:00Z"
```

## Available Services (v2.0)

**BREAKING CHANGE**: v2.0 uses **switch entities** instead of service calls.

The Emergency Alerts Card toggles switch entities when action buttons are clicked. For each alert binary sensor, the backend creates three switch entities:

### Switch Entity Pattern
```yaml
# For binary_sensor: binary_sensor.emergency_fire_alarm
# The backend creates these switches:

switch.emergency_fire_alarm_acknowledged   # Acknowledge switch
switch.emergency_fire_alarm_snoozed       # Snooze switch
switch.emergency_fire_alarm_resolved      # Resolve switch
```

### Acknowledge Alert (v2.0)
```yaml
service: switch.toggle
data:
  entity_id: switch.emergency_fire_alarm_acknowledged
```

### Snooze Alert (v2.0 - NEW)
```yaml
service: switch.turn_on
data:
  entity_id: switch.emergency_fire_alarm_snoozed
```

### Resolve Alert (v2.0 - RENAMED from clear)
```yaml
service: switch.toggle
data:
  entity_id: switch.emergency_fire_alarm_resolved
```

### Note on Escalation
Escalation in v2.0 is **automatic** (5-minute timer) and has no manual service call. To de-escalate, simply acknowledge the alert, which automatically turns off escalation.

## Screenshots

> **Note**: Screenshots will be added to the `docs/screenshots/` directory. These will show the card in various configurations and states.

### Planned Screenshots
- **Basic Card**: Default configuration showing mixed alert types
- **Compact Mode**: Mobile-friendly compact display
- **Grouped View**: Alerts grouped by severity/status/group
- **Action Buttons**: Different button styles (compact, full, icons_only)
- **Filtered Views**: Security-only, critical-only, etc.
- **Alert States**: Active, acknowledged, escalated, cleared states
- **Mobile View**: Card appearance on mobile devices

## Development

### Setup
```bash
npm install
```

### Testing with Home Assistant Devcontainer

If you have the Emergency Alerts integration running in a devcontainer (as in this project structure), you can easily test the card:

```bash
# Quick deploy to Home Assistant
./dev-with-ha.sh

npm run build:deploy

# For continuous development (rebuilds and deploys on changes)
npm run dev:deploy
```

This will:
1. Build the card from TypeScript
2. Copy `emergency-alerts-card.js` to `../emergency_alerts/config/www/`
3. Make it available in Home Assistant as `/local/emergency-alerts-card.js`

### Testing
```bash
# Run tests
npm test
